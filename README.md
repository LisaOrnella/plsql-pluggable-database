### ISSUES ENCOUNTERED

## Issues Encountered & Solutions

### ðŸ”§ Issue 1: Insufficient Privileges for PDB Operations
- **Problem:** Received "insufficient privileges" error when trying to create and drop PDBs.
- **Solution:** Connected to the root container with SYSDBA privileges using:
  ```sql
  CONNECT sys AS SYSDBA
  ```

### ðŸ”§ Issue 2: Finding Container Names
**Problem:** Didn't know the correct container names to switch between databases
**Solution:** Used these commands to find containers:
```sql
SHOW CON_NAME
SELECT name, con_id, open_mode FROM v$containers;
SELECT name, open_mode FROM v$pdbs;
```
### ðŸ”§ Issue 3: PDB Not Accessible
**Problem:** PDBs created but couldn't connect to them
**Solution:** Opened PDBs after creation:
```sql
SHOW CON_NAME
SELECT name, con_id, open_mode FROM v$containers;
SELECT name, open_modeÂ FROMÂ v$pdbs;
```
